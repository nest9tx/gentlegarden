## Deployment Steps

1. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Ensure all production environment variables are set
   - Verify Stripe webhook endpoint points to production URL
   - Confirm Supabase project is production-ready

3. **Database Preparation**
   - Ensure production database has correct schema
   - Test database connectivity from production environment

4. **Deploy Application**
   - Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Verify deployment completed successfully

5. **Post-Deployment Testing**
   - Test user registration/login
   - Process test payment (small amount, then refund)
   - Verify webhook receives and processes payment events
   - Test tier-based functionality across all pages

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Track
- Payment success rates
- Webhook processing success
- User tier distribution
- Garden Guide usage patterns
- Error rates and performance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Monitor Stripe webhook logs
- Review database performance
- Update content for different tiers
- Monitor user feedback and usage patterns

### Backup and Recovery
- Ensure regular database backups
- Document environment variable configuration
- Keep deployment configuration in version control

## Emergency Procedures

### If Webhooks Fail
1. Check Stripe webhook logs
2. Verify webhook endpoint is accessible
3. Check application logs for errors
4. Manually update user tiers if necessary

### If Payments Fail
1. Check Stripe dashboard for issues
2. Verify API keys are correct
3. Review application error logs
4. Contact users if widespread issues

### Database Issues
1. Check Supabase status page
2. Verify connection strings
3. Review recent schema changes
4. Restore from backup if necessary

The application is now production-ready with proper error handling, security measures, and monitoring capabilities in place.
